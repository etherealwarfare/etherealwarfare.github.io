                    <p> In one of my courses focused on Technical Writing in the Computer Industry, our final project was to develop a substantial
                        user tutorial about a topic of our choice. With relevance to myself and my peers, I chose to help out new college students
                        or non-tech-savvy students on how they can use Discord for school related needs, and why it's a better option compared with
                        other collaborative software.

                        In this tutorial I talked about how to set up your account, how to make/join servers for classes or extracurriculars, tips
                        to stay safe, and so much more.
